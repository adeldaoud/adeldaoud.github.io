### Articles in Peer-Reviewed Journals

1. Accepted. Daoud, Adel, Alexander Kentikelenis, Thomas Stubbs, Lawrence King. “The International Monetary Fund’s Interventions in Food and Agriculture: An Analysis of Loans and Conditions”, Food Policy, 5yr Impact factor: 4.1, (cit. NA). Contributions: conceived the research topic and led the research: AD. Designed the research: AD, LPK. Programmed the text-mining algorithm: AD. Collected the FAO data: AD. Collected the IMF data: AEK and TS. Performed the qualitative content analysis: AD, LPK. Wrote the manuscript: AD. Revised the manuscript: AD, BR, LK, AEK and THS. This paper uses a computational text-extracting method to identify to what extent the IMF target food and agriculture globally, where it lacks mandate and competence.
2.	Accepted. Daoud, Adel and Nandy, Shailen, Implications of the politics of caste and class on child poverty in India, Sociology of Development, 5yr Impact factor: NA, (cit. NA) Contributions: Conceived and designed the research topic: AD, SN. Collected the state-level data: AD. Collected the micro data: SN. Performed the statistical analysis: AD. Interpreted the results: AD, SN. Wrote the manuscript: AD, SN. Revised the manuscript: AD, SN. This paper contributes to this newly established journal by evaluating the relative importance of caste versus class on child poverty. It finds that the politics of caste explains a large amount of the variations between Indian states. 
3.	2019. Kraamwinkel, N., Ekbrand, H., Davia, S., Daoud, A., The influence of maternal agency on child well-being in conflict-ridden Nigeria: modelling heterogeneous treatment effects with machine learning. PLoS ONE 5yr Impact factor: 2.8, (cit. NA). Contributions: conceived the research topic: AD NK. Led the research: NK. Collected the data: HE. Performed the analysis: NK HE. Wrote the manuscript: NK, SD, AD. Revised the manuscript: NK, SD, HE, AD. In this work I mentored—hence I am the senior author—my Ph.D. student Kraamwinkel to use machine learning for causal inference. This work is published in PloS ONE’s special issue on machine learning in the health and social sciences.
4.	2018. Daoud, Adel, and Bernhard Reinsberg, “Structural adjustment, state capacity, and child health: Evidence from IMF programs,” International Journal of Epidemiology. 5yr Impact factor: 10.2, (cit. NA). Contributions: A.D. and B.R. designed research; B.R. analyzed data; A.D. and B.R. interpreted the results, and A.D. and B.R. wrote the paper. This paper shows for the first time how types of policies (privatization, liberalization, deregulation, and stabilization) of an IMF program effect children.
5.	2018. Daoud, Adel, “Unifying studies of Scarcity, Abundance, and Sufficiency”, Ecological Economics. Vol 147, Issue: May, pp. 208 – 217. 5yr Impact factor: 4.8, (cit. 2) This is a conceptual contribution where I propose a framework that analyses the dynamics between scarcity, abundance, and sufficiency, for research of poverty, environment, and related fields.
6.	2017. Daoud, Adel, Elias Nosrati, Bernhard Reinsberg, Alexander Kentikelenis, Thomas Stubbs, and Lawrence King, ”Impact of International Monetary Fund programs on child health“, Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 5yr Impact factor: 10.4, (cit. 9) Contributions: A.D. and L.P.K. designed research; A.D. performed research; A.D. collected the data; A.D. analyzed data; and A.D. wrote the paper in collaboration with E.N., B.R., A.E.K., T.H.S., and L.P.K.

This paper shows, contrary to the established understanding, that the Malthusian and Senian approaches complement each other in explaining famine.

A global comparison of some of the realities of climate change” PLoS ONE, 11(4),  5yr Impact factor: 2.8, (cit. 13). Contributions: Designed the experiments: AD. Performed the experiments: AD.
