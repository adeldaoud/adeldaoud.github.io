# How Much Do Sociologists Write About Economic Topics? Supplementary data and resources

In this webpage, you will find additional visualizations complementing my and my co-author´s paper:

* 2016 **Daoud, Adel** and Kohl, Sebastian, How Much Do Sociologists Write About Economic Topics? Using Big-Data to Test Some Conventional Views in Economic Sociology, 1890 to 2014. MPIfG Discussion Paper 16/7 (peer-reviewed)
[the paper](http://www.mpifg.de/pu/mpifg_dp/dp16-7.pdf).

This is still a working paper, which means that results might change. Below you will find the most recent statistical estimations about the topical orientation of sociology journals for the topics: economic (political economy) and organization/social-theory (the new economic sociology). Additionally, I am building a Shiny app where you will be able to produce customized versions of the heat-maps used in the paper - see below for examples. 

## Journals´ economic orientation 
Journals can be more or less oriented towards economic topics. This graph captures the additional (average) probability of this orientation. Journals above the zero-line are more oriented towards economic topics than journals below this line. *Acta Turistica* has the highest economic orientation, and *Analise Social* the lowest. The zero-line is the sample average. The confidence interval describes the statistical certainty.
