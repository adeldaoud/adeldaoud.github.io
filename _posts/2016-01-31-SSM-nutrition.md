# How do Changes in Food Prices impact Child Undernutrition?

In the following paper, my colleagues and I estimate the effect of food price on child undernutrition in Nigeria and Ethiopia. We find a that children are adversely affectd by increasing food prices, especially children living in poor rural areas. We also find that Ethiopia has dealt with increasing food prices better than in Nigeria. We theorize that this might be due to Ethiopia´s investment in various food policy programms.
