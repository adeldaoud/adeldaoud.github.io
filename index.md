## A Social Scientist Interested in Global Issues and New Ways of Portraying the World
I work on figuring out why we have so much poverty in a world of plenty. Why societies often value financial resources, over peoples´ health – or worse, lifes. How children suffer because of dysfunctional goverments and institutions. Or, because their parents and ancestors made bad choices: from hindering them from education, to, going to war with a neighbouring country. Societies can only improve, if the opportunities for its children cultivats – so kids can flourish.  

I pursue to examine these question preferably by using well-founded social theorizing combined with large data, and robust methodologies. For these reasons, my work tend to be quantitative. I seek to learn and implement new techniques (e.g. [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)) and ways of picturing insightfull visualizations from information (inspired by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)). 

I happened to have a Ph.D. in sociology, but could have equaly had it in economics, political science, or mathematics. I work with colleagues from varous disciplines and several countries (most notably, the US, the UK, Germany, France, Sweden). 

My normative aim is – to borrow from Aristotle´s idea on eudaimonia – to contribute to the betterment of our global society so all individuals can flourish. My research is a small piece adding to that.
