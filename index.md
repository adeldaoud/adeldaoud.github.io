I work on figuring out why we have so much poverty in a world of plenty. My research revolves around the question why societies often value financial resources over peoples' health or lives. Another focal point is how families and their children suffer because of dysfunctional governments, institutions, or policies. Societies will develop, if children are enabled to flourish. 

I pursue to examine these question preferably by using well-founded social theorizing combined with large global data, and robust methodologies. I seek to learn and implement new techniques (e.g. [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)) and ways of picturing insightful visualizations of information (inspired by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)). 

I happened to have a Ph.D. in sociology, but could have equally had it in economics, political science, or mathematics. I work with colleagues from various disciplines and several countries (most notably, the US, the UK, Germany, Sweden).

My normative aim is – inspired by Aristotle´s idea on eudaimonia – to contribute to the betterment of our global society so all individuals can flourish. My research is a small piece adding to that.
